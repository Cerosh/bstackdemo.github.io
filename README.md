# bstackdemo.github.io

**Functionality**: Place an order for iPhone 15 using mock data in the bstackdemo

**Features**
- Multi-level assertions allow for hierarchical testing of conditions within a single test case. This means you can perform assertions at different levels or layers of the application or data, ensuring that complex conditions and interactions are correctly validated.
- Publishing to GitHub Pages allows the hosting of static websites directly from a GitHub repository. This is particularly useful for sharing documentation.
- Mocking-in tests involve creating simulated versions of services that mimic their behaviour without requiring the actual implementation.
