# bstackdemo.github.io

**Functionality**: Place an order for iPhone 12 Pro in the bstackdemo

**Features**:
- Implemented consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and files throughout the codebase to improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration.
- Improved error handling mechanisms have been implemented, ensuring more reliable test execution and easier issue debugging.-
- Separated concerns, such as data handling, test logic, and utility functions, to enhance modularity, reusability, and maintainability. This allows for focused testing and debugging.-
- Created a utility method to identify and fill form fields based on labels, with integrated error handling. This method streamlines interactions, reduces code duplication, and improves reliability.
- Added checks for environment variables to ensure they are correctly set before executing tests. Validating environment variables before test execution helps avoid configuration-related issues and ensures that tests run in the appropriate context, leading to more accurate test results and reducing the likelihood of environment-specific errors.

**Limitations**:
- The assertion is missing to validate that the selected and checked-out items are identical.
