Functionality: Place an order for iPhone 12 Mini in the bstackdemo

# Limitations
Even though the script uses various Playwright APIs to interact with the webpage, there are some areas for improvement.

1. The script doesn't include any error handling or recovery mechanisms. If an action fails (e.g., an element is not found), the script will likely stop executing or fail abruptly. Lack of error handling can lead to incomplete test runs or misleading results if a failure occurs.
